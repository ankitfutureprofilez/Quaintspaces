              <p>
                You can search for Host Services by using criteria like the type
                of Host Service, type of listing, travel destination, travel
                dates, and number of guests. You can also use filters to refine
                your search results. Search results are based on their relevance
                to your search and other criteria. Relevance considers factors
                like price, availability, reviews, customer service and
                cancellation history, popularity, previous trips and saved
                Listings, Host requirements (e.g. minimum or maximum nights),
                and more.

              <p>
                When you book a Listing, you are agreeing to pay all charges for
                your booking including the Listing price, applicable fees like
                ’s service fee, offline fees, taxes and any other items
                identified during checkout (collectively, “Total Price”). If you
                choose to pay using a currency that differs from the currency
                set by the Host for their Listing, the price displayed to you is
                based on a currency conversion rate determined by us. When you
                receive the booking confirmation, a contract for Host Services
                (a "Reservation") is formed directly between you and the Host.
                In addition to these Terms, you will be subject to, and
                responsible for complying with, all terms of the Reservation,
                including without limitation, the cancellation policy and any
                other rules, standards, policies, or requirements identified in
                the Listing or during checkout that apply to the Reservation. It
                is your responsibility to read and understand these rules,
                standards, policies, and requirements prior to booking a
                Listing. Be aware that some Hosts work with a co-host or as part
                of a team to provide their Host Services.

                An Accommodation Reservation is a limited license to enter,
                occupy and use the Accommodation. The Host retains the right to
                re-enter the Accommodation during your stay, to the extent: (i)

                reasonable overstay penalties. You may not exceed the maximum

                An Experience or other Host Service Reservation entitles you to

                You are responsible for confirming that you, and anyone you

                impact your ability to participate, attend or use the Experience
                or Host Service. Except where expressly authorized, you may not

              <h2>2.1 Cancellations, Reservation Issues, and Refunds.</h2>
              <p>
                In general, if you cancel a Reservation, the amount refunded to
                you is determined by the cancellation policy that applies to
                that Reservation. But, in certain situations, other policies may
                take precedence and determine what amount is refunded to you. If
                something outside your control requires you to cancel a
                Reservation, you may be entitled to a partial or full refund as
                per our decision.. If the Host cancels, or you experience a
                Reservation Issue (as defined in our Rebooking and Refund
                Policy), you may be entitled to rebooking assistance or a
                partial or full refund under our Rebooking and Refund Policy.
                Different policies apply to certain categories of Listings; for
                example, Experiences Reservations are governed by the
                Experiences Guest Refund Policy. See each Additional Legal Term
                or Policy for details about what is covered, and what refund
                applies in each situation.

                If the Host and Guest cannot resolve, or a Guest fails to pay a
                Damage Claim, the Host may notify Quaint Spaces through the
                Resolution Center under the terms of the Host Damage Protection
                Terms and seek compensation. Quaint Spaces will review the Damage
                Claim and ask the Host to provide any required evidence (e.g.
                through appropriate documents, photos, invoices, or third-party
                experts) which substantiates the Damage Claim and the Damage
                Claim amount. The Guest will be given the opportunity to respond
                and provide any relevant counter evidence. If Quaint Spaces
                determines, under consideration of the evidence provided, the
                Host Damage Protection Terms, and applicable statutory rules on
                the burden of proof that the Guest is responsible for the Damage
                Claim, Quaint Spaces (via Quaint Spaces Payments) will pay out the
                Damage Claim to the Host. If Quaint Spaces pays out the Damage
                Claim to the Host, Quaint Spaces may collect the amount of the
                Damage Claim from the Guest, including by charging the guest’s
                Payment Method up to a maximum amount of $500 USD. Quaint Spaces
                may also pursue claims for recovering Damage Claims amounts,
                including amounts exceeding the maximum amount applicable for
                charging the Guest’s Payment Method, against a Guest using any
                remedies it may have available under applicable law, including
                referral of the matter to a collections agency, and/or pursuit
                of available causes of action and/or claims against a Guest.
                Members may appeal a decision by Quaint Spaces by contacting our
                customer service. As between Members and Quaint Spaces, the
                burden of proof regarding the Damage Claim and the Damage Claim

              We offer you the right to use a platform that enables Members to
              publish, offer, search for, and book Host Services. When Members
              make or accept a booking, they are entering into a contract
              directly with each other. Quaint Spaces is not and does not become
              a party to or other participant in any contractual relationship
              between Members. Quaint Spaces is not acting as an agent for any
              Member except for where Quaint Spaces Payments acts as a collection
              agent as provided in the Payments Terms. While we work hard to
              ensure our Members have great experiences using Quaint Spaces, we
              do not and cannot control the conduct or performance of Guests and
              Hosts and do not guarantee (i) the existence, quality, safety,

              Quaint Spaces has the right to review, disable access to, remove,
              or edit Content to: (i) operate, secure and improve the
              Quaint Spaces Platform (including for fraud prevention, risk
              assessment, investigation and customer support purposes); (ii)
              ensure Members’ compliance with these Terms; (iii) comply with
              applicable law or the order or requirement of a court, law
              enforcement or other administrative agency or governmental body;
              (iv) address Member Content that we determine is harmful or

                Section 16.3 does not apply for damages arising from breaches of
                essential contractual obligations based on simple negligence.
                For such damages by Quaint Spaces, its legal representatives or
                other vicarious agents, Quaint Spaces’s liability is limited to
                the typically occurring foreseeable damages. Essential
                contractual obligations are such duties of Quaint Spaces in whose
                proper fulfillment you regularly trust and must trust for the
                proper execution of the contract.

                parties are unable to resolve the dispute within the 30-day
                period, only then may either party commence arbitration by
                filing a written demand for arbitration with the arbitration
                provider designated pursuant to Section 19.6, below. A
                claimant’s Pre-Dispute Notice requirement is a prerequisite to
                any arbitration, and a copy of the Pre-Dispute Notice and
                evidence that it was sent as required by this Section must be
                attached to any arbitration demand.

                involve the same or coordinated counsel for the parties (“Mass
                Action”). Accordingly, you and Quaint Spaces agree to waive the
                right to have any Dispute administered, arbitrated, or resolved
                as part of a Mass Action (though Sections 23 and 19.12 of these
                Terms will continue to apply to the Dispute). In case of a
                dispute, the appointed arbitrator for the first matter
                instituted within a set of claims identified by either party
                shall decide whether those claims are part of a Mass Action. If
                no arbitrator has yet been appointed, an arbitrator shall be
                appointed solely to determine whether claims identified by
                either party are part of a Mass Action. Nothing in this
                provision prevents you or Quaint Spaces from participating in a
                mass settlement of claims.If Quaint Spaces amends this Section 25
                after the date you last accepted these Terms (or accepted any
                subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject the change by
                sending us written notice no later than 30 days of the date the
                change is effective. Your notice must include your name, mailing
                address, the date of the notice, your Quaint Spaces username, the
                email address you used to set up your Quaint Spaces account, your
                signature, and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out
                of the amended Section 19. You must either mail your notice to
                this address: 888 Brannan St, San Francisco, CA 94103, Attn:
                Arbitration Opt-Out, or email the opt-out notice to
                arbitration.opt.out@Quaint Spaces.com. Rejecting a new change,
                however, does not revoke or alter your prior consent to any
                earlier agreements to arbitrate any Dispute between you and
                Quaint Spaces (or your prior consent to any subsequent changes
                thereto), which will remain in effect and enforceable as to any
                Dispute between you and Quaint Spaces.
